BUSINESS PROPOSAL FOR AI PRODUCT

This project provides an overview of a business proposal for an Artificial Intelligence based product. In this proposal, Healthy Living Partner(HLP) is the product being proposed. The project shows how Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence can be applied in the design of the product. It is presented in a question and answer format.
Further in my the presentation, you will find relevant information on how to take the product vision through development, pre-launch, launch and post-launch.

Machine Learning models experimentation is based on Google Cloud ML/Pytorch and AmazonSageMaker/Notebook configuration instances. This is work in progress.

Other projects with Machine Learning and Articial Intellegience applications include:
1. Medical Imaging(CT) - This involves identifying patterns and recognizing/detecting traces of Pneumonia in and around human Lungs and Diaphragms.
2. Medical Treatment Applications - Applying predictive algorithms to treatment planning for Mdeical/Healthcare service providers.
